# NVMe drivers for Windows 7
> Requires SP1. Install `Windows6.1-KB2990941-x64.msu` first. Only install `windows6.1-kb3087873-v2-x64_098e3dc3e7133ba8a37b2e47260cd8cba960deb8` if you get a 0x0000007E BSoD after installing the driver.

Afterwards, integrate or install the Samsung NVMe driver, replacing the default NVMe controller driver if doing it from a working install. The Samsung NVMe driver is a better driver that allows you to view SMART data, among other things.

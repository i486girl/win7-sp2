## Installation

> [!CAUTION]
> Failure to follow instructions properly will result in a bricked system! We do not take responsibility for this unless this is a legitimate bug in the installer!

> [!IMPORTANT]
> RAID/Intel RST only works on specific systems!

> [!WARNING]
> Both versions of the Windows 7 Service Pack 2 are x64 only! Don't file issues over the lack of 32-bit hardware support as we do not plan to support 32-bit hardware. Consult the FAQ for more information.

### ISO installation

> [!IMPORTANT]
> The ISO releases are for clean installs only. For in-place installs, please use the installer once we release a working version of it.

1. Pick the UEFI or Legacy Boot version, depending on what your system uses
2. Flash it onto a DVD or a USB flash drive
3. Boot from the Windows 7 install media on the machine you wish to install it in
4. Proceed as usual
5. Finish the out of box experience

### In-place intallation

- Download the Windows 7 SP2 installer under the releases of this repository
- Follow the steps in the installer as usual

> [!WARNING]
> If the installer is stuck at a certain percentage (during the Upgrading Windows phase), don't turn off your computer! Doing so will brick your system!

## FAQ

### Q: My system is 32-bit in hardware. Why won't the installer and the ISO run?

A: Supporting both 64-bit and 32-bit Windows would be very time consuming, so we chose to support only 64-bit systems. Please don't file any issues regarding the lack of 32-bit support as we have no interests of making any releases targeting 32-bit hardware.

### Q: Why don't you include ESU updates?

A: ESU updates will be rolled out by Microsoft until 2026, and unfortunately adding ESU updates will be time consuming as it requires us to roll out new releases every time a batch of ESU updates gets rolled out.

### Q: Why VxKex instead of the dotexe1337 Windows 7 Extended Kernel?

A: VxKex is safer than dotexe's Windows 7 Extended Kernel as it relies on external DLLs.

### Q: Does this include custom integrated GPU dri-

A: **NO**

### Q: Why aren't my drives appearing in the Windows Setup screen?

A: If you are using an RAID/RST configuration, it may well likely be that the drivers installed do not work.
